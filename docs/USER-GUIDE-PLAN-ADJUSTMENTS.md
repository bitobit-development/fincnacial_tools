# User Guide: Adjusting Your Retirement Plan

Welcome to the Plan Adjustments feature! This guide will help you understand how to customize your retirement plan parameters and see the impact of your changes.

## Overview

The AI Advisor has analyzed your financial situation and provided recommendations. However, you might want to adjust these recommendations based on your personal preferences, risk tolerance, or financial goals. The Plan Adjustments feature lets you customize three key parameters:

- **Monthly RA Contribution:** How much you contribute to your Retirement Annuity each month
- **Investment Return Rate:** Expected annual return on your investments
- **Inflation Rate:** Expected annual inflation rate

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Navigate to the Recommendations Tab

1. Open your web browser and go to the AI Advisor page
2. You'll see three tabs at the top: **Overview**, **Recommendations**, and **Chat**
3. Click on the **Recommendations** tab

You should now see the Plan Adjustments panel with three sliders.

### Step 2: Understanding the Current View

Before making changes, take a moment to understand what you're seeing:

**AI Recommended Values:**
- Each slider has a marker (📌) showing the AI's recommended value
- These recommendations are based on your financial profile and goals
- They represent conservative, achievable targets

**Current Values:**
- The slider position shows the current value (either AI-recommended or your previously saved adjustments)
- If you've saved custom values before, the sliders will show those instead

**Impact Summary:**
- Below the sliders, you'll see how your current settings compare to AI recommendations
- Shows the difference in retirement nest egg and monthly drawdown

## Adjusting Your Plan

### Step 3: Modify Parameters

You can adjust any of the three parameters:

#### Monthly RA Contribution

**What it is:** The amount you contribute to your Retirement Annuity each month.

**Range:** R 0 to R 500,000

**How to adjust:**
1. Click and drag the slider left (decrease) or right (increase)
2. OR click on the number input and type a specific amount
3. See the impact update in real-time

**Example:**
- AI recommends: R 20,000/month
- You adjust to: R 25,000/month
- Impact: Higher retirement savings, but less money available now

**Considerations:**
- Can you afford this contribution with your current budget?
- Does it align with your other financial goals?
- Are you maxing out tax benefits?

#### Investment Return Rate

**What it is:** The expected annual return on your retirement investments.

**Range:** 0% to 15%

**How to adjust:**
1. Drag the slider to set your expected return
2. OR type a percentage directly

**Example:**
- AI recommends: 7.0% (conservative estimate)
- You adjust to: 8.5% (more optimistic)
- Impact: Higher projected retirement savings

**Considerations:**
- What's realistic based on your investment strategy?
- Are you comfortable with the risk required for higher returns?
- Have you researched historical returns for your asset mix?

**Warning:** Setting unrealistically high returns can lead to disappointing results. Be conservative in your estimates.

#### Inflation Rate

**What it is:** The expected annual increase in cost of living.

**Range:** 0% to 10%

**How to adjust:**
1. Move the slider to adjust inflation expectations
2. OR enter a specific percentage

**Example:**
- AI recommends: 6.0% (based on South African averages)
- You adjust to: 5.5% (more optimistic)
- Impact: Higher purchasing power in retirement

**Considerations:**
- What's the historical inflation rate in South Africa?
- Do you expect inflation to rise or fall in the coming decades?
- Are your expenses likely to track general inflation?

### Step 4: Review the Impact

As you adjust the sliders, the **Impact Summary** updates automatically:

**Nest Egg at Retirement:**
- Shows the difference between your adjustments and AI recommendations
- **Positive (+R 125,450):** Your adjustments lead to higher savings
- **Negative (-R 50,000):** Your adjustments lead to lower savings
- **Color coding:** Green for positive, red for negative

**Monthly Drawdown:**
- Shows how much you can withdraw each month in retirement
- **Positive (+R 1,250):** You'll have more to spend monthly
- **Negative (-R 500):** You'll have less to spend monthly
- **Color coding:** Green for positive, red for negative

**Example Impact:**
```
If you increase monthly contribution from R 20,000 to R 25,000
AND increase expected returns from 7% to 8.5%:

Nest Egg at Retirement:  +R 125,450 (vs AI recommendation)
Monthly Drawdown:        +R 1,250 (vs AI recommendation)
```

This means you'll have R 125,450 more saved and can withdraw R 1,250 more per month in retirement.

## Saving Your Adjustments

### Step 5: Save Your Changes

Once you're happy with your adjustments:

1. Click the **"Save Adjustments"** button at the bottom of the panel
2. Wait for the confirmation message: **"Adjustments saved successfully"**
3. The badge at the top will change from "Unsaved changes" to "Changes saved"

**What happens when you save:**
- Your custom values are stored in the database
- They persist across page refreshes and browser sessions
- The AI chatbot will use these values in future recommendations
- You can return later and see your saved values

**Important:** You MUST click "Save Adjustments" for changes to persist. Simply moving the sliders doesn't save anything.

### Step 6: Using the AI Chatbot with Your Adjustments

After saving your adjustments, you can chat with the AI advisor:

1. Click on the **Chat** tab
2. Ask questions about your retirement plan
3. The AI will use your custom values in its responses

**Example conversation:**

> **You:** How much will I have saved when I retire?

> **AI:** Based on your adjusted monthly contribution of R 25,000 and expected investment return of 8.5%, you'll have approximately R 4.5 million saved when you retire at age 65. This is higher than the initial projection due to your increased contribution and return expectations.

Notice how the AI acknowledges your custom values ("your adjusted monthly contribution of R 25,000").

## Understanding Status Badges

At the top of the Plan Adjustments panel, you'll see a status badge:

### 🟡 "Unsaved changes"

**Meaning:** You've moved the sliders but haven't saved yet.

**What to do:**
- Review your changes in the Impact Summary
- Click "Save Adjustments" to persist your changes
- OR click "Reset to AI" to discard changes

### 🟢 "Changes saved"

**Meaning:** Your adjustments are saved and match the current slider positions.

**What this means:**
- Your changes are persisted in the database
- Refreshing the page will show your saved values
- The AI chatbot knows about your adjustments

### 🔵 "Modified"

**Meaning:** You have saved adjustments that differ from AI recommendations.

**What this means:**
- You've customized your plan
- Your values are different from what the AI suggested
- The AI respects your choices in its recommendations

## Resetting to AI Recommendations

### Step 7: Reset to AI Values (Optional)

If you want to go back to the AI's original recommendations:

1. Click the **"Reset to AI"** button
2. All sliders will move to the AI-recommended positions
3. The badge will show "Unsaved changes"
4. Review the new values
5. Click **"Save Adjustments"** to make the reset permanent

**When to reset:**
- You're not happy with your custom values
- You want to see the AI's original recommendations again
- You've been experimenting and want to start fresh

**Note:** Resetting doesn't automatically save. You must click "Save Adjustments" to persist the reset.

## Tips for Effective Planning

- Higher returns require more risk
- Ensure your risk tolerance matches your expectations
- Diversify investments to manage risk

### Consider Multiple Scenarios

### Use the AI Chatbot
